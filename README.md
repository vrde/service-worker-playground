# Service Worker API + PWA Playground

(PWA = Progressive Web App)

Notes on how to make things work smoothly when building a PWA. I'm testing this to make a PWA that works smoothly on Android, iOS, and in general as many platforms as possible.

To test it go to https://vrde.github.io/service-worker-playground.
